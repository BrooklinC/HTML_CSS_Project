## Project Requirements

### Content
My HTML/CSS Project can best be described as project not perfection but I've learnt an absolute tonne and will only improve in the next module. This has been a lot to learn in a very short period of time and I haven't nailed all the elements - for example my nav links for some reason look like hyperlinks and not white buttons but frankly, being as sick as I am right now, I'm taking the win that I'm submitting anything at all. 

The colour scheme I chose is based on my own business, Aletheia Enterprises. The front page features an about me section with an amazing shot of me drinking wine in the Barossa (fun times). It then has a brief snapshot of who I am and highlights some of my professional experience. The Contact Form is at the bottom of the page and can be reached either through scrolling down or clicking the Contact Me in the header. The Projects page is a separate HTML page and can be reached by selecting Projects in the Header. In the Projects page there is a Coding languages and Projects section. There are functional links to my Github and LinkedIn on both pages. 
​
### Technical
There are 2 web pages - a Home page and a Projects page. Everything has been version controlled with Git and deployed on Github pages. There are some basic responsive design principles with the hamburger navigation and contact form reshaping but honestly this is not yet a strong suit of mine and I really struggled with making everything work. Maya was a great help but I certainly have not nailed it. I've attempted to use semantic HTML but not sure this is a strong suit either.

### Bonus (optional)
Not completed but will try for next time
