## Project Requirements

### Content
The colour scheme I chose is based on my own business, Aletheia Enterprises. The front page features an about me section with an amazing shot of me drinking wine in the Barossa (fun times). It then has a brief snapshot of who I am and highlights some of my professional experience. The Contact Form is at the bottom of the page and can be reached either through scrolling down or clicking the Contact Me in the header. The Projects page is a separate HTML page and can be reached by selecting Projects in the Header. In the Projects page there is a Coding languages and Projects section. There are functional links to my Github and LinkedIn on both pages. 
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
There are 2 web pages - a Home page and a Projects page. Everything has been version controlled with Git and deployed on Github pages. There are some basic responsive design principles with the hamburger navigation and contact form reshaping but honestly this is not yet a strong suit of mine. I've attempted to use semantic HTML but not sure this is a strong suit either.

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:

> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
